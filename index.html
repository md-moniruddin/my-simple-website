        <p>Divisions are subdivided into districts (zila).
             There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further 
             subdivided into upazila (subdistricts) or thana. The area 
             within each police station, except for those in metropolitan
              areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting
               of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations 
               are divided into wards, further divided into mahallas.

            There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels,
             and the administration is composed only of government officials. 
             Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson 
             and several members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve
              three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates</p>
